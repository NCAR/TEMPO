Thompson-Eidhammer Microphysics Parameterization for Operations

# About
This repository houses the Thompson-Eidhammer Microphysics Parameterization for Operations, or TEMPO. TEMPO predicts clouds and precipitation in Earth-system models and is a continuation of the Thompson microphysics parameterization that is a popular choice in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and run operationally in the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR). TEMPO has been designed as a submodule so that development and changes are saved in a commit history, independent of a specific modeling framework.

The `main` branch of TEMPO is running in RRFSv2 development systems which use a UFS-community fork of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS[^1]) as a dynamical core.

Several key publications describe the research and model development that is contained in TEMPO. Note that code changes do occur -- mathematical formulations may be different in the code than as described in publications.
